## About Me

Hey! I'm Khubaib Shaikh (kas021). Most of my time goes into building web apps with TypeScript and Python. Started with smaller projects but quickly got hooked on full-stack development. There's something satisfying about seeing both the frontend and backend come together, especially when it actually works on the first try (which, let's be honest, rarely happens).

Right now I'm juggling a few TypeScript projects. Got a CMS system in the works, plus some management tools that I'm tinkering with. React and Next.js have been my go-to lately, though I keep finding myself diving deeper into Python automation whenever I get the chance. Built this NFC attendance system using a Raspberry Pi last year. That was a fun rabbit hole to go down. Cards, readers, audio alerts, the whole nine yards.

I've pushed about 445 commits in the last year, give or take. Not all winners, but you learn more from the code that breaks anyway. Always down to collaborate if you're working on something interesting with TypeScript or Python. Hit me up if you want to talk about web dev, automation, or IoT stuff. Also made a crypto bot once. Jury's still out on whether that was genius or madness.

## Featured Projects

### [Employee NFC Logging System](https://github.com/kas021/Employee-NFC-Logging-Time-Sheet)

This one was born out of pure necessity. Needed a way to track employee check-ins without the usual hassle of manual logs or buggy software. Grabbed a Raspberry Pi, some NFC readers, and built a system that logs everything straight to Google Sheets. Added audio alerts too because why not. Makes it feel more official. Python made the whole thing surprisingly straightforward once I figured out the NFC library quirks.

### [Money Game](https://github.com/kas021/money-game)

Built this as a way to make financial concepts less boring. It's an interactive game written in TypeScript where you manage money and make decisions. Nothing groundbreaking, but people seem to find it useful for understanding budgeting without falling asleep. Plus, it was a good excuse to experiment with game logic in a web environment.

### [Crypto Bot](https://github.com/kas021/Crypto-bot)

Yeah, I made one of these. Trading bot written in Python that attempts to automate crypto trades. Does it make millions? No. Does it work? Sometimes. Honestly built it more to learn about APIs and trading algorithms than to get rich quick. The market's too unpredictable anyway, but the code itself taught me a lot about async operations and data handling.

### [CMS Repository](https://github.com/kas021/CMS-REPO)

Content management system built with TypeScript. Started this because most CMS platforms feel bloated or overcomplicated for what I needed. Wanted something clean and modular that I could customize without fighting against the framework. Still adding features, but it handles the basics well. Create, edit, publish, repeat.
